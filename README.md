# TCP Login Framework
A C# framework using SimpleTCP for handling logins 

## Usage
Select your network adapter's IP and enter a port that is within the range of 1024-65535. This range exists as it is a non reserved range.

After that, edit the textBox2.Text property to be the path to your login.php

Finally edit your Client.cs to have the private IP address of your network adapter if it is running on the same network OR enter the public IP address of the server (requires port forwarding)
